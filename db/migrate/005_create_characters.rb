# Write a migration for the characters table. A character should have a name, actor_id, and a show_id––a character will belong to a show (the show migration is already provided) and an actor, and we'll keep track of this relationship with these database table columns.

      create_table :characters do |t|
        t.string :name
        t.integer :actor_id
        t.integer :show_id
